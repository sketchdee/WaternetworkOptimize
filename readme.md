-   ObjectFunction.m is objective function

-   Optimize2.m calculate the the constrain matrix and run optimize process

-   Test.m is used to find the best result in (0,100] ,with the constrain calculated
    in Optimize2.m

-   Result_Check.m check the result x and get the Concentration calculation
    result Optimize2.m

-   Plot.mlx is matlab file type,plot the tree view figure.
